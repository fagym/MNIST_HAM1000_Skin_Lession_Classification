# MNIST HAM10000 Skin Lesions Classification
In this research, an Android-based application will be designed to classify skin diseases in real-time using CNN methods. Dermoscopy image data is taken from the MNIST HAM10000 dataset, which consists of 10,015 images. The dataset is divided into seven disease classes that fall under the category of skin cancer. Testing and training of the model will be done using five pre-trained models provided by Keras: ResNet50V2, DenseNet121, InceptionV3, Xception, and MobileNet. During training, each model will be tested for its classification performance based on changes in several hyperparameter variables, including learning rate, optimizer, batch size, and dropout. An improvement in performance was obtained for each model after testing with adjustments to the training hyperparameters. The Xception model achieved the best accuracy at 92.5%. This model was then implemented in an Android-based application. The testing results on Android showed the same accuracy for original images, but a decrease in accuracy was observed when testing with the camera, which might be cause by noise or differences in resolution.
